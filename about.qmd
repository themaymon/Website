## My Story
### The Experimental Psychology Trade-Off

My journey into Virtual Reality (VR) began with a frustration that every experimental psychologist eventually faces: **The trade-off between experimental control and ecological validity.**

During my PhD at Victoria University of Wellington, I was investigating *Theory of Mind*—how we understand the intentions of others. Like many before me, I found myself stuck between two imperfect choices. I could run highly controlled experiments on a computer screen (which lacked *verisimilitude*: the messy reality of actual environments), or I could run field studies (which are more *ecologically* valid but are impossible to control scientifically).

Generally speaking This disconnect has seemed intractable. We were studying human behavior by removing the "human" and the "behavior" from the equation.

### An "Accidental" Pivot

By complete chance, I stumbled upon a basic VR setup being tested in our department. I realized almost immediately that this technology wasn't just a gimmick for gamers; it was the solution to the Trade-Off.

VR allowed me to place participants in "real" situations—standing at the edge of a cliff, walking a plank, or interacting with a virtual agent—while maintaining millisecond-level control over every photon of light they saw. 

I pivoted my research focus entirely. I taught myself Unity and C#, not because I wanted to be a developer, but because I needed better tools to answer scientific questions. This work culminated in my research on **Presence**—understanding not just *if* people feel fear in VR, but *why* they treat virtual threats as real.

### Open Science & Reproducibility

As I built more complex simulations, I realized another problem: **Reproducibility.**

A text-based methods section in a PDF cannot possibly capture the complexity of a VR environment. If I say "the participant stood on a ledge," how high was it? How was the lighting? What was the physics engine doing?

This realization turned me into a fierce advocate for **Open Science**. I believe that code *is* the method. Today, I publish my datasets, analysis code (R/Python), and VR environments (Unity) openly. I advocate for a science where "replicating a study" means downloading the environment and hitting 'Play'.

### Current Work

Today, I wear three hats:
1.  **Lecturer:** Teaching the next generation of psychologists how to use these tools. I teach courses on Experimental Design, VR Development, and Data Analysis.
2.  **Researcher:** Investigating research questions about emotions, emotion regulations, the relationship between emotion and cognition, and how our minds construct our reality.
3.  **Consultant:** Helping other labs and companies build valid, reliable, and rigorous VR experiments.
