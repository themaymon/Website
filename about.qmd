### The "Control" Problem

My journey into Virtual Reality (VR) began with a frustration that every experimental psychologist eventually faces: **The Trade-Off.**

During my PhD at Victoria University of Wellington, I was investigating *Theory of Mind*—how we understand the intentions of others. Like many before me, I found myself stuck between two imperfect choices. I could run highly controlled experiments on a computer screen (which lacked the messy reality of actual human interaction), or I could run field studies (which had "ecological validity" but were impossible to control scientifically).

For years, this disconnect seemed intractable. We were studying human behavior by removing the "human" and the "behavior" from the equation.

### The "Accidental" Pivot

By complete chance, I stumbled upon a basic VR setup being tested in our department. I realized almost immediately that this technology wasn't just a gimmick for gamers; it was the solution to the Trade-Off.

VR allowed me to place participants in "real" situations—standing at the edge of a cliff, walking a plank, or interacting with a virtual agent—while maintaining millisecond-level control over every photon of light they saw. 

I pivoted my research focus entirely. I taught myself Unity and C#, not because I wanted to be a developer, but because I needed better tools to answer scientific questions. This work culminated in my research on **Presence**—understanding not just *if* people feel fear in VR, but *why* they treat virtual threats as real.

### Open Science & Reproducibility

As I built more complex simulations, I realized another problem: **Reproducibility.**

A text-based methods section in a PDF cannot possibly capture the complexity of a VR environment. If I say "the participant stood on a ledge," how high was it? How was the lighting? What was the physics engine doing?

This realization turned me into a fierce advocate for **Open Science**. I believe that code *is* the method. Today, I publish my datasets, analysis code (R/Python), and VR environments (Unity) openly. I advocate for a science where "replicating a study" means downloading the environment and hitting 'Play'.

### Current Work

Today, I wear three hats:
1.  **Lecturer:** Teaching the next generation of psychologists how to use these tools.
2.  **Researcher:** Investigating emotion regulation and the "Sense of Presence."
3.  **Consultant:** Helping other labs and companies build valid, reliable, and rigorous VR experiments.
