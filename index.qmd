# Christopher N Maymon, PhD

**Human Factors Consultant | Experimental Psychologist | VR & Simulation Specialist**

I help organisations design technology, training, and work systems that fit real human capabilities—so they are **safer**, **easier to use**, and **more effective in the field**.

I’m a cognitive psychologist and experimental methodologist with deep experience translating research into practical improvements for complex environments. My approach combines **human factors / ergonomics**, **ecologically valid experimentation**, and modern measurement—using tools like **virtual reality**, **mobile biosensors**, and **data analytics**—to understand how people perceive, decide, coordinate, and perform under real-world constraints.

I work with labs, companies, and government agencies to reduce human error, improve usability, and strengthen performance—without hype or hand-waving. When the question is “Will this system work for people *in practice*?”, I help you answer it with evidence.

I provide end-to-end [consulting services](consulting.qmd): from problem framing and study design to data collection, analysis, and clear recommendations your team can implement.

## How I Can Help

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}
### 🧠 Human Factors & Usability Evaluation
Are users struggling, making errors, or developing workarounds? I evaluate **human–system interaction** to identify where interfaces, procedures, and environments create friction—then I deliver actionable fixes.

Typical work includes task analysis, workflow mapping, usability testing, cognitive walkthroughs, error analysis, and evidence-based recommendations for safer and more intuitive systems.

### 🥽 VR & Simulation for Human Performance
I build and use **high-fidelity VR simulations** that let teams test designs and undergo training in realistic conditions—before products are deployed at scale.

I support organisations that want to (a) establish VR capability, (b) prototype and evaluate procedures or interfaces, or (c) develop **bespoke simulations** for human factors research and performance training.

### 📊 Experimental Design, Measurement & Data Analysis
If you need answers that hold up under scrutiny, I design studies that are **reproducible**, interpretable, and aligned to operational decisions. I build measurement plans, choose appropriate statistical models, and communicate results clearly to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

This is ideal for A/B tests, field trials, intervention evaluations, and any situation where you need credible evidence—not just opinions.
