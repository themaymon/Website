# Christopher N Maymon, PhD

**Experimental Psychologist | VR Developer | Data Analyst**

I am cognitive psychologist, experimental methodologist, teacher, and research consultant.

My specialty is designing **ecologically valid experiments** capable of yielding profound insights into complex psychological phenomena. My [research](publications.qmd) integrates emerging technologies—such as **virtual reality**, **mobile biosensors**, and **artificial intelligence**—to study important theoretically grounded questions about the nature of cognition, emotions, and consciousness.

An experimentalist at heart, I am perpetually on the hunt for important empirical hypotheses that can be demonstrating using a straightforward but thoughtfully designed experiment.

I provide end-to-end [consulting services](consulting.qmd) to labs, companies, and government agencies.

From 2018 to 2025, I served as Director of Victoria University of Wellington's Virtual Reality Neuroscience Lab. In this role, I developed methodologies for **ecologically valid experiments**, navigating the rapid evolution of VR hardware and software. I offer consultation to universities establishing VR facilities, as well as the development of **bespoke VR simulations** tailored to your specific research questions.

I am a Lecturer with ten years of experience teaching topics ranging from statistics to neurobiology. My goal is always to connect the material to concrete aspects of my students' lived experiences. My teaching approach holds attention, aids retention, and—most importantly—inspires curiosity. I offer workshops and consultation to those tasked with translating complex ideas into clear, actionable insights.
