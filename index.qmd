# Christopher N Maymon, PhD

**Experimental Psychologist | VR Developer | Data Analyst | Psychophysiologist**

I am a psychological scientist, teacher, and research consultant.

I specialize in designing ecologically valid experiments to answer complex psychological questions. My work integrates emerging technologies—such as immersive **virtual reality**, mobile **biosensing**, and **artificial intelligence**—to study human behavior in the real world.

An experimentalist at heart, I am constantly seeking open psychological questions that can be resolved through carefully designed research.

I provide end-to-end [consulting services](consulting.qmd) to researchers, labs, and companies.

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}
### 📊 Experimental Design & Analysis
Do you have complex data but aren't sure how to analyze it? Or perhaps you have a hypothesis but need help designing an experiment to test it. I specialize in building **interpretable and reproducible research pipelines**. I help you explore, visualize, and statistically model your results in a way that is rigorous and appropriate, elucidating underlying patterns and relationships.

From 2018 to 2025, I served as Director of Victoria University of Wellington's Virtual Reality Neuroscience Lab. In this role, I developed methodologies for **ecologically valid experiments**, navigating the rapid evolution of VR hardware and software. I offer consultation to universities establishing VR facilities, as well as the development of **bespoke VR simulations** tailored to your specific research questions.

I am a Lecturer with ten years of experience teaching topics ranging from statistics to neurobiology. My goal is always to connect the material to concrete aspects of my students' lived experiences. My teaching approach holds attention, aids retention, and—most importantly—inspires curiosity. I offer workshops and consultation to those tasked with translating complex ideas into clear, actionable insights.
