# Christopher N Maymon, PhD

**Experimental Psychologist | VR Developer | Data Analyst**

I am a psychological scientist, teacher, and research consultant.

I specialize in designing **ecologically valid experiments** capable of yielding answers to complex psychological questions. In my [research](research.qmd), I integrate emerging technologies—such like **virtual reality**, **biosensors**, and **artificial intelligence** to study human behavior as it occurs in the real world.

An experimentalist at heart, I am constantly searching for research questions that can be resolved through carefully designed experiments.

I provide end-to-end [consulting services](consulting.qmd) to research labs, companies, and government agencies.

I am a Lecturer with ten years of experience teaching topics ranging from statistics to neurobiology. My goal is always to connect the material to concrete aspects of my students' lived experiences. My teaching approach holds attention, aids retention, and—most importantly—inspires curiosity. I offer workshops and consultation to those tasked with translating complex ideas into clear, actionable insights.
