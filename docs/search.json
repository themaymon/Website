    "text": "The “Control” Problem\nMy journey into Virtual Reality (VR) began with a frustration that every experimental psychologist eventually faces: The Trade-Off.\nDuring my PhD at Victoria University of Wellington, I was investigating Theory of Mind—how we understand the intentions of others. Like many before me, I found myself stuck between two imperfect choices. I could run highly controlled experiments on a computer screen (which lacked the messy reality of actual human interaction), or I could run field studies (which had “ecological validity” but were impossible to control scientifically).\nFor years, this disconnect seemed intractable. We were studying human behavior by removing the “human” and the “behavior” from the equation.\n\n\nThe “Accidental” Pivot\nBy complete chance, I stumbled upon a basic VR setup being tested in our department. I realized almost immediately that this technology wasn’t just a gimmick for gamers; it was the solution to the Trade-Off.\nVR allowed me to place participants in “real” situations—standing at the edge of a cliff, walking a plank, or interacting with a virtual agent—while maintaining millisecond-level control over every photon of light they saw.\nI pivoted my research focus entirely. I taught myself Unity and C#, not because I wanted to be a developer, but because I needed better tools to answer scientific questions. This work culminated in my research on Presence—understanding not just if people feel fear in VR, but why they treat virtual threats as real.\n\n\nOpen Science & Reproducibility\nAs I built more complex simulations, I realized another problem: Reproducibility.\nA text-based methods section in a PDF cannot possibly capture the complexity of a VR environment. If I say “the participant stood on a ledge,” how high was it? How was the lighting? What was the physics engine doing?\nThis realization turned me into a fierce advocate for Open Science. I believe that code is the method. Today, I publish my datasets, analysis code (R/Python), and VR environments (Unity) openly. I advocate for a science where “replicating a study” means downloading the environment and hitting ‘Play’.\n\n\nCurrent Work\nToday, I wear three hats: 1. Lecturer: Teaching the next generation of psychologists how to use these tools. 2. Researcher: Investigating emotion regulation and the “Sense of Presence.” 3. Consultant: Helping other labs and companies build valid, reliable, and rigorous VR experiments.\nIf you are interested in discussing experimental design, VR development, or data analysis, please get in touch."

    "section": "Core Research Areas",
    "text": "Core Research Areas\n\n1. The Nature of Presence\nWhat makes a virtual experience feel “real”?\nMy recent work challenges the traditional “bottom-up” view that physiological arousal drives the sense of presence. In our recent paper in Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, we demonstrated that subjective fear—not physiological arousal—shapes the experience of presence.\nUsing a high-fidelity “Virtual Plank” simulation, we dissociated these two systems. This supports constructionist theories of emotion (e.g., Lisa Feldman Barrett), suggesting that “Presence” is a top-down cognitive conceptualization, not just a visceral reaction to sensory input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Finding\n\n\n\n“Presence is not just about higher resolution graphics; it is about the meaning the user assigns to the environment. If the brain constructs a threat narrative, the environment becomes ‘real,’ regardless of heart rate.”\n\n\n\n\n2. Emotion Regulation Under Threat\nHow do we regulate fear when the threat feels immediate?\nTraditional labs study fear using static images on a computer screen. But looking at a picture of a spider is fundamentally different from standing on a ledge 80 floors up.\nI use VR to induce high-intensity threat states in the lab. My “Virtual Plank” and “Filthy Bathroom” (Disgust) paradigms allow us to test: * Inhibitory Control: Does fear paralyze us or speed us up? (See my work on the Stop Signal Task on a plank). * Reappraisal vs. Suppression: Can you “think” your way out of fear when your visual system is screaming “danger”? * Physiological Synchrony: How do EEG and EDA signals align with behavioral freezing?\n\n\n3. Methodological Innovation\nStandardizing the “VR Neuroscience Lab”\nA major barrier to adoption is the technical complexity of setting up a VR lab. My paper “Launching Your VR Neuroscience Laboratory” serves as a blueprint for other researchers. I am committed to Open Science: * Open Assets: I release the Unity environments for my tasks so others can replicate them exactly. * Open Code: Data analysis pipelines (R/Python) are shared to ensure reproducibility."

It is the real phenomenon you are trying to find. * The Water is the Noise (measurement error, individual differences). * The Tide Level is your Statistical Power.\n\nScenario A: Low Power (High Tide)\nImagine the tide is incredibly high. The water is deep and choppy. Somewhere beneath those waves, there is a rock. It is definitely there (the effect exists!), but the noise of the water is completely covering it.\nYou look for an hour and see nothing. You conclude: “There is no rock here.” In statistics, we call this a Type II Error (False Negative). The rock didn’t vanish; you just lacked the power to see it through the noise.\n\n\nScenario B: High Power (Low Tide)\nNow, imagine we lower the tide. The water level drops. The waves settle. Suddenly, the jagged tip of the rock breaks the surface. You didn’t make the rock bigger; you just removed the noise that was hiding it.\nThis is what happens when we increase sample size or reduce measurement error (e.g., using a precise VR tracker instead of a stopwatch). We lower the water level so the signal becomes visible."

    "text": "The “Big Rock” Fallacy\nMany researchers try to fix a “High Tide” problem by looking for a “Bigger Rock.”\nThey think: “If I just make my manipulation stronger (a louder noise, a scarier VR cliff), the effect will be massive, and I’ll see it even if my sample is small.”\nThis works… sometimes. If the rock is a mountain, you will see it even at high tide. But most effects in psychology aren’t mountains; they are pebbles. We are looking for subtle changes in reaction time or slight shifts in emotion regulation.\nIf you are looking for a pebble at high tide, no amount of squinting (p-hacking) will save you. You need to drain the water."

    "text": "Why Simulation Matters\nThis is why I advocate for Simulation Science.\nIn a traditional field study, the “weather” is unpredictable. The waves are choppy (high noise). In a Virtual Reality lab, I control the weather. I can turn off the wind. I can perfectly standardize the environment.\nBy using VR, we are essentially building a breakwall around our study. We calm the waters, reducing the noise variance, which makes even small rocks visible.\nWe don’t need “bigger” effects; we need calmer water.\n\nEnjoyed this metaphor?
