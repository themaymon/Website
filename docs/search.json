    "text": "My journey into Virtual Reality (VR) began with a frustration that every experimental psychologist eventually faces: The trade-off between experimental control and ecological validity.\nDuring my PhD at Victoria University of Wellington, I was investigating Theory of Mind—how we understand the intentions of others. Like many before me, I found myself stuck between two imperfect choices. I could run highly controlled experiments on a computer screen (which lacked verisimilitude: the messy reality of actual environments), or I could run field studies (which are more ecologically valid but are impossible to control scientifically).\nGenerally speaking This disconnect has seemed intractable. We were studying human behavior by removing the “human” and the “behavior” from the equation.\n\n\n\nBy complete chance, I stumbled upon a basic VR setup being tested in our department. I realized almost immediately that this technology wasn’t just a gimmick for gamers; it was the solution to the Trade-Off.\nVR allowed me to place participants in “real” situations—standing at the edge of a cliff, walking a plank, or interacting with a virtual agent—while maintaining millisecond-level control over every photon of light they saw.\nI pivoted my research focus entirely. I taught myself Unity and C#, not because I wanted to be a developer, but because I needed better tools to answer scientific questions. This work culminated in my research on Presence—understanding not just if people feel fear in VR, but why they treat virtual threats as real.\n\n\n\nAs I built more complex simulations, I realized another problem: Reproducibility.\nA text-based methods section in a PDF cannot possibly capture the complexity of a VR environment. If I say “the participant stood on a ledge,” how high was it? How was the lighting? What was the physics engine doing?\nThis realization turned me into a fierce advocate for Open Science. I believe that code is the method. Today, I publish my datasets, analysis code (R/Python), and VR environments (Unity) openly. I advocate for a science where “replicating a study” means downloading the environment and hitting ‘Play’.\n\n\n\nToday, I wear three hats: 1. Lecturer: Teaching the next generation of psychologists how to use these tools. I teach courses on Experimental Design, VR Development, and Data Analysis. 2. Researcher: Investigating research questions about emotions, emotion regulations, the relationship between emotion and cognition, and how our minds construct our reality. 3. Consultant: Helping other labs and companies build valid, reliable, and rigorous VR experiments.\nIf you are interested in discussing experimental design, VR development, or data analysis, please get in touch."

Or perhaps you already have the technology and software, and you want to know what research questions could be addressed with your product?\nAs an experimental psychologist with a specialization in VR research methods, I can help design your research project, from storyboarding the ideal conditions for testing a specific hypothesis, to developing and programming bespoke VR contexts, creating clear step-by-step protocols for extracting behavioural data and submitting that data for statistical analysis, and interpreting the results of those analyses. I’m a one-stop-shop for any VR research project.\n\nServices\n\nCustom VR Environemnt Development: From simple environments to complex, interactive social simulations, I will create the optimal experimental conditions to acheive the aims of your project.\nTechnological Integration: Does your project require the integration of different technological systems? Perhaps you need to synchronise events in VR with datastreams you are collecting from participants such as ECG, EEG, or electrodermal activity? I can create technological architecture that seamlessly integrates data streams across distinct hardware and software.\n“Presence” Optimization: The most essential benchmark of a good VR experience is that users feel that they are present in the environemnt. As a leading voice in the psychological science of conscious presence, I am well positioned to audit your VR experience, preparing in-depth evaluations of the user experience with concrete design recommendations supported by empirical peer-reviewed neuroscience research.\n\n\n\n\nAre you a researchers who has a file-drawer of data you don’t know how to analyse or interpret? Are you a company whose products create potentially insightful data but you’re not sure how to extract those insights?\nI have a strong background in statistical programming and create reproducible reports. I have spent over a decade working with large, complex and messy datasets (e.g., eye-tracking data in VR, markerless motion capture data, psychophysiological data, mobile electroencephalography data, etc.). I don’t just run the numbers for you; I also implement complete coding architectures (written in R and/or Python) tailored for your specific data and reserach questions. This ensures that my process – from data manipulation to visualization to analysis and summarization – is transparently documented and most importantly, fully reproducible.\n\nServices\n\nStatistical Modeling: Selecting appropriate statistical tests for your data is critical to the success of your project. And it can often be a daunting task, even if you have a strong statistical background. I help you choose the right models for your data, whether that be linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, Bayesian hierarchical models, or machine learning approaches.\nPhysiological Signal Processing: Physiological data can yield fascinating insights into psychological experience. However, physiological data is also often messy, and subject to many sources of potential measurement error or confounding variables. I have been working with physiological data for several years to conduct psychophysiological research (using Empatica E4 wearable devices, Equivital Lifemonitor vests, three-lead ADInstruments ECG systems, and Biopac wireless ECG, EDA, and Impedance Cardiography systems), and their respective softwares. I can help you to clean and analyze physiological data to extract meaningful insights (backed by leading empirical, peer-reviewed psychophysiological research) to elucidate the connections between psychological experience and physiological change.\nReproducible Analytic Pipelines: High-Impact journals are increasingly placing value on transparent scientific reporting, where readers can trace the research from the published manuscript all the way back to the steps they took to transform their data and prepare it for analysis. If you have already analysed your data using Jamovi, SPSS, etc., and you want to turn your report into a reproducible manuscript, I can create the reproducible automated workflow that will make your paper stand out and hold up to scrutiny in today’s scientific reporting climate.\nData Visualization: Every scientific study is a story. Moreover, the story of scientific discovery is not a dense tome of text, but is instead a picture-book of graphs and figures that clearly highlighte the main findings. I can create Publication-ready figures (ggplot2), and interactive dashboards (Shiny/Quarto), to reveal the story within your data.\n\n\n\n\n“I have a research question, but I don’t know if it’s feasible in VR.”\nTranslating a traditional lab study into VR requires navigating unique challenges: hardware limitations, motion sickness risks, and ethical constraints. I help you design studies that are rigorous, ethical, and publishable.\n\nServices\n\nFeasibility Reviews: rapid assessment of whether your research question works in VR.\nEthical Guidance: Assistance with ethics applications specifically for immersive fear/threat studies.\nPre-registration Support: Helping you define your variables and analysis plan before you collect data (Open Science best practices)."

My work demonstrates that Virtual Reality (VR) allows us to break this trade-off, enabling us to study complex, high-stakes emotional experiences—like fear, awe, and disgust—without sacrificing millisecond-level experimental precision."

    "text": "Core Research Areas\n\n1. The Nature of Presence\nWhat makes a virtual experience feel “real”?\nMy recent work challenges the traditional “bottom-up” view that physiological arousal drives the sense of presence. In our recent paper in Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, we demonstrated that subjective fear—not physiological arousal—shapes the experience of presence.\nUsing a high-fidelity “Virtual Plank” simulation, we dissociated these two systems. This supports constructionist theories of emotion (e.g., Lisa Feldman Barrett), suggesting that “Presence” is a top-down cognitive conceptualization, not just a visceral reaction to sensory input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Finding\n\n\n\n“Presence is not just about higher resolution graphics; it is about the meaning the user assigns to the environment. If the brain constructs a threat narrative, the environment becomes ‘real,’ regardless of heart rate.”\n\n\n\n\n2. Emotion Regulation Under Threat\nHow do we regulate fear when the threat feels immediate?\nTraditional labs study fear using static images on a computer screen. But looking at a picture of a spider is fundamentally different from standing on a ledge 80 floors up.\nI use VR to induce high-intensity threat states in the lab. My “Virtual Plank” and “Filthy Bathroom” (Disgust) paradigms allow us to test: * Inhibitory Control: Does fear paralyze us or speed us up? (See my work on the Stop Signal Task on a plank). * Reappraisal vs. Suppression: Can you “think” your way out of fear when your visual system is screaming “danger”? * Physiological Synchrony: How do EEG and EDA signals align with behavioral freezing?\n\n\n3. Methodological Innovation\nStandardizing the “VR Neuroscience Lab”\nA major barrier to adoption is the technical complexity of setting up a VR lab. My paper “Launching Your VR Neuroscience Laboratory” serves as a blueprint for other researchers. I am committed to Open Science: * Open Assets: I release the Unity environments for my tasks so others can replicate them exactly. * Open Code: Data analysis pipelines (R/Python) are shared to ensure reproducibility."

They don’t help a student visualize why their experiment failed.\nInstead, I prefer to teach Power using the metaphor of The Tides."

    "text": "The Rock and The Water\nImagine you are standing on a cliff looking down at a turbulent ocean. Your goal is simple: Spot the Rock.\nIn this metaphor: * The Rock is your Effect Size. It is the real phenomenon you are trying to find. * The Water is the Noise (measurement error, individual differences). * The Tide Level is your Statistical Power.\n\nScenario A: Low Power (High Tide)\nImagine the tide is incredibly high. The water is deep and choppy. Somewhere beneath those waves, there is a rock. It is definitely there (the effect exists!), but the noise of the water is completely covering it.\nYou look for an hour and see nothing. You conclude: “There is no rock here.” In statistics, we call this a Type II Error (False Negative). The rock didn’t vanish; you just lacked the power to see it through the noise.\n\n\nScenario B: High Power (Low Tide)\nNow, imagine we lower the tide. The water level drops. The waves settle. Suddenly, the jagged tip of the rock breaks the surface. You didn’t make the rock bigger; you just removed the noise that was hiding it.\nThis is what happens when we increase sample size or reduce measurement error (e.g., using a precise VR tracker instead of a stopwatch). We lower the water level so the signal becomes visible."

    "text": "The “Big Rock” Fallacy\nMany researchers try to fix a “High Tide” problem by looking for a “Bigger Rock.”\nThey think: “If I just make my manipulation stronger (a louder noise, a scarier VR cliff), the effect will be massive, and I’ll see it even if my sample is small.”\nThis works… sometimes. If the rock is a mountain, you will see it even at high tide. But most effects in psychology aren’t mountains; they are pebbles. We are looking for subtle changes in reaction time or slight shifts in emotion regulation.\nIf you are looking for a pebble at high tide, no amount of squinting (p-hacking) will save you. You need to drain the water."

In a Virtual Reality lab, I control the weather. I can turn off the wind. I can perfectly standardize the environment.\nBy using VR, we are essentially building a breakwall around our study. We calm the waters, reducing the noise variance, which makes even small rocks visible.\nWe don’t need “bigger” effects; we need calmer water.\n\nEnjoyed this metaphor?

    "section": "",
    "text": "My journey into Virtual Reality (VR) began with a frustration that every experimental psychologist eventually faces: The trade-off between experimental control and ecological validity.\nDuring my PhD at Victoria University of Wellington, I was investigating Theory of Mind—how we understand the intentions of others. Like many before me, I found myself stuck between two imperfect choices. I could run highly controlled experiments on a computer screen (which lacked verisimilitude: the messy reality of actual environments), or I could run field studies (which are more ecologically valid but are impossible to control scientifically).\nGenerally speaking This disconnect has seemed intractable. We were studying human behavior by removing the “human” and the “behavior” from the equation.\n\n\n\nBy complete chance, I stumbled upon a basic VR setup being tested in our department. I realized almost immediately that this technology wasn’t just a gimmick for gamers; it was the solution to the Trade-Off.\nVR allowed me to place participants in “real” situations—standing at the edge of a cliff, walking a plank, or interacting with a virtual agent—while maintaining millisecond-level control over every photon of light they saw.\nI pivoted my research focus entirely. I taught myself Unity and C#, not because I wanted to be a developer, but because I needed better tools to answer scientific questions. This work culminated in my research on Presence—understanding not just if people feel fear in VR, but why they treat virtual threats as real.\n\n\n\nAs I built more complex simulations, I realized another problem: Reproducibility.\nA text-based methods section in a PDF cannot possibly capture the complexity of a VR environment. If I say “the participant stood on a ledge,” how high was it? How was the lighting? What was the physics engine doing?\nThis realization turned me into a fierce advocate for Open Science. I believe that code is the method. Today, I publish my datasets, analysis code (R/Python), and VR environments (Unity) openly. I advocate for a science where “replicating a study” means downloading the environment and hitting ‘Play’.\n\n\n\nToday, I wear three hats: 1. Lecturer: Teaching the next generation of psychologists how to use these tools. I teach courses on Experimental Design, VR Development, and Data Analysis. 2. Researcher: Investigating research questions about emotions, emotion regulations, the relationship between emotion and cognition, and how our minds construct our reality. 3. Consultant: Helping other labs and companies build valid, reliable, and rigorous VR experiments.\nIf you are interested in discussing experimental design, VR development, or data analysis, please get in touch."
