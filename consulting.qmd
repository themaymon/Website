I offer specialized consulting for academic labs, startups, and tech companies working at the intersection of human behavior and technology. 

Unlike generalist developers, I build systems designed for **scientific validity**. Unlike generalist researchers, I can implement the **technical architecture** required to run complex studies.

## My Expertise

::: {.panel-tabset}

### 🥽 VR Development
**"I need a VR environment that is scientifically valid, not just visually pretty."**

I build custom Unity environments optimized for behavioral research. My focus is on **Presence**—ensuring participants treat the virtual world as real—and precise **event timing** for physiological synchronization.

#### Services
*   **Custom Unity (C#) Development:** From simple tasks to complex, interactive social simulations.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Synchronizing VR events with EEG, EDA (GSR), and Heart Rate data streams.
*   **"Presence" Optimization:** Audit of existing environments to improve immersion and reduce motion sickness.
*   **Motion Capture:** Implementation of full-body avatars and inverse kinematics (IK) for behavioral tracking.

### 📊 Data Analysis
**"I have complex, noisy data and I need a robust, reproducible analysis."**

I specialize in **Bayesian Statistics** and **Multilevel Modeling**, particularly for complex datasets common in psychophysiology and longitudinal studies. I don't just run the numbers; I provide the code to ensure your results are reproducible.

#### Services
*   **Bayesian Modeling:** Implementation of JAGS/Stan models for complex hierarchical data.
*   **Physiological Signal Processing:** Cleaning and analyzing noisy EEG/EDA data.
*   **Reproducible Pipelines:** converting your manual spreadsheet workflow into an automated R or Python script.
*   **Data Visualization:** Publication-ready figures (ggplot2) and interactive dashboards (Shiny/Quarto).

### 🔬 Experimental Design
**"I have a research question, but I don't know if it's feasible in VR."**

Translating a traditional lab study into VR requires navigating unique challenges: hardware limitations, motion sickness risks, and ethical constraints. I help you design studies that are rigorous, ethical, and publishable.

#### Services
*   **Feasibility Reviews:** rapid assessment of whether your research question works in VR.
*   **Ethical Guidance:** Assistance with ethics applications specifically for immersive fear/threat studies.
*   **Pre-registration Support:** Helping you define your variables and analysis plan *before* you collect data (Open Science best practices).

## How I Work

I believe in the **"Open Science"** model of consulting. You don't just get a PDF report; you get the assets, the code, and the documentation.

### 1. The Discovery Call (Free)
We meet for 30 minutes to discuss your research question or technical bottleneck. I will tell you honestly if I am the right fit.
*   *Outcome:* A clear "Go / No-Go" decision.

### 2. The Blueprint
I deliver a detailed scope of work. For VR projects, this includes a "grey-box" prototype video. For analysis, this includes a mock-up of the final report.
*   *Outcome:* You know exactly what you are paying for.

### 3. Execution & Handoff
I build the solution and then **train you** on how to use it. I provide commented code and video walkthroughs so your lab is not dependent on me forever.
*   *Outcome:* A sustainable tool for your research.
