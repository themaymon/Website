I offer specialized **human factors / ergonomics consulting** for labs, startups, and technology teams building systems that people must use *reliably*—in the real world, under real constraints.

I help you design and evaluate tools, interfaces, and workflows for **usability**, **safety**, and **human performance**. When needed, I build the technical research architecture to support strong inference: studies that are **ecologically valid**, **reproducible**, and decision-relevant.

## Availability
I am currently accepting new projects for **Q1/Q2 2026**. [Contact me](contact.qmd) to discuss fit, scope, and timeline.

## What I Deliver

- **Clear evidence** about what users can (and cannot) do with your system
- **Risk-reducing recommendations** grounded in data (not opinions)
- **Validated prototypes** and/or simulation-based evaluations before costly deployment
- **Reusable measurement & analysis pipelines** your team can run again

## My Services & Expertise

::: {.panel-tabset}

### 🧠 Human Factors & Usability Evaluation
**Do you need to know whether your product, interface, or procedure will work for people *in practice*—and where errors, friction, or confusion are coming from?**

I run human factors evaluations that map real user goals onto real task demands. This includes identifying failure points (where users misinterpret cues, choose the wrong action, or miss critical information), and turning those findings into **concrete design changes**.

#### Services
* **Task & workflow analysis:** Decompose tasks, decision points, and handoffs; identify cognitive load and bottlenecks.
* **Usability testing:** Plan and run studies; define success metrics; capture qualitative + behavioral measures.
* **Error analysis & risk-oriented evaluation:** Identify likely error pathways and mitigation strategies (interface, procedure, training).
* **Human-centered requirements & design guidance:** Translate findings into implementable requirements and prioritized recommendations.
* **Evaluation reporting for stakeholders:** Concise, decision-ready outputs for product, engineering, and leadership.

### 🥽 VR & Simulation for Human Performance
**Do you want to test an interface, workflow, or training approach in conditions that are closer to real life—before you roll it out?**

As a cognitive experimental psychologist, I have harnessed VR simulations to create **high-control, high-realism** testbeds—ideal for investigating human factors questions where field testing would be expensive or dangerous.

#### Services
* **Simulation-based prototyping:** Build VR scenarios that reflect real-world tasks, constraints, and environmental demands.
* **Human factors evaluation in VR:** Measure human performance, errors, attention, workload, and adaptation across conditions.
* **Technology & sensor integration:** Synchronise events in VR with data streams (e.g., ECG/EEG/EDA, eye-tracking, motion capture).
* **Presence & experiential realism (when it matters):** Audit and optimise factors that influence user engagement, behavior, and transfer.
* **Bespoke VR development:** From simple environments to interactive simulations tailored to your evaluation goals.

### 📊 Measurement, Experimental Design & Data Analysis
**Do you have complex data but need trustworthy answers—or do you need a study designed so the results actually generalize?**

I build **reproducible analytic pipelines** and design studies that support clear conclusions. This is especially useful when your data are messy, multi-modal, or high-frequency (e.g., VR telemetry, biosignal feedback).

#### Services
* **Study design for strong inference:** Hypotheses, operational definitions, sampling, power/sensitivity, and analysis plans.
* **Statistical modeling:** Mixed models, GAMs, Bayesian hierarchical models, and (when appropriate) machine learning—aligned to the question.
* **Physiological signal processing:** Cleaning, artifact handling, feature extraction, and interpretation for physiological (e.g., ECG/EDA/EEG) data streams.
* **Reproducible reporting:** Automated, transparent workflows that produce publication- and stakeholder-ready reports.
* **Visualization & dashboards:** Aesthetically pleasant publication-ready figures and interactive dashboards that clearly portray the story of your findings.

## Engagements That Fit Well

- **Product teams** shipping systems where usability failures are costly (health, safety, public services, enterprise tools)
- **R&D groups** needing credible evidence for claims, funding, or regulatory conversations
- **Training & operations teams** testing whether learning transfers to real performance
- **Labs & startups** building or validating VR/simulation-based research and assessment tools

If you’re unsure whether your project is “human factors” or “research,” that’s fine—many projects are both. We can frame the question in a way that produces actionable evidence.

## How I Work

I use an **open, reproducible** model of consulting. You don’t just receive a report—you receive the assets that make the work durable: code, documentation, and (where relevant) prototypes and data dictionaries. The goal is to leave you with a capability, not a dependency.

### 1. The Discovery Call (Free)
We schedule a **30-minute call** to understand your context, constraints, and what “success” looks like. I’ll tell you candidly whether I’m a good fit—and if not, what kind of specialist you likely need.

*Outcome:* A clear go/no-go decision and a rough path to scope.

### 2. First Deliverable: *The Blueprint*
I deliver a blueprint that defines scope, measures, and deliverables.

- For human factors projects: task model, evaluation plan, success criteria, and reporting format  
- For VR projects: storyboard + “grey-box” prototype video  
- For data work: mock-up of the final report/dashboard + analysis plan

*Outcome:* You know exactly what you’re paying for, and what decisions the work will support.

### 3. Second Deliverable: *Execution & Handoff*
I build, evaluate, and deliver—then **train your team** to run and extend the system. You receive commented code and clear documentation (plus walkthrough videos when helpful).

*Outcome:* A sustainable toolchain and evidence you can reuse.
