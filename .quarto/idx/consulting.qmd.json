This includes identifying failure points (where users misinterpret cues, choose the wrong action, or miss critical information), and turning those findings into **concrete design changes**.\n\n#### Services\n* **Task & workflow analysis:** Decompose tasks, decision points, and handoffs; identify cognitive load and bottlenecks.\n* **Usability testing:** Plan and run studies; define success metrics; capture qualitative + behavioral measures.\n* **Error analysis & risk-oriented evaluation:** Identify likely error pathways and mitigation strategies (interface, procedure, training).\n* **Human-centered requirements & design guidance:** Translate findings into implementable requirements and prioritized recommendations.\n* **Evaluation reporting for stakeholders:** Concise, decision-ready outputs for product, engineering, and leadership.\n\n---\n\n### 🥽 VR & Simulation for Human Performance\n**Do you want to test an interface, workflow, or training approach in conditions that are closer to real life—before you roll it out?**\n\nAs a cognitive experimental psychologist, I have harnessed VR simulations to create **high-control, high-realism** testbeds—ideal for investigating human factors questions where field testing would be expensive or dangerous.\n\n#### Services\n* **Simulation-based prototyping:** Build VR scenarios that reflect real-world tasks, constraints, and environmental demands.\n* **Human factors evaluation in VR:** Measure human performance, errors, attention, workload, and adaptation across conditions.\n* **Technology & sensor integration:** Synchronise events in VR with data streams (e.g., ECG/EEG/EDA, eye-tracking, motion capture).\n* **Presence & experiential realism (when it matters):** Audit and optimise factors that influence user engagement, behavior, and transfer.\n* **Bespoke VR development:** From simple environments to interactive simulations tailored to your evaluation goals.\n\n---\n\n### 📊 Measurement, Experimental Design & Data Analysis\n**Do you have complex data but need trustworthy answers—or do you need a study designed so the results actually generalize?**\n\nI build **reproducible analytic pipelines** and design studies that support clear conclusions. This is especially useful when your data are messy, multi-modal, or high-frequency (e.g., VR telemetry, biosignal feedback).\n\n#### Services\n* **Study design for strong inference:** Hypotheses, operational definitions, sampling, power/sensitivity, and analysis plans.\n* **Statistical modeling:** Mixed models, GAMs, Bayesian hierarchical models, and (when appropriate) machine learning—aligned to the question.\n* **Physiological signal processing:** Cleaning, artifact handling, feature extraction, and interpretation for physiological (e.g., ECG/EDA/EEG) data streams.\n* **Reproducible reporting:** Automated, transparent workflows that produce publication- and stakeholder-ready reports.\n* **Visualization & dashboards:** Aesthetically pleasant publication-ready figures and interactive dashboards that clearly portray the story of your findings.\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Engagements That Fit Well\n\n- **Product teams** shipping systems where usability failures are costly (health, safety, public services, enterprise tools)\n- **R&D groups** needing credible evidence for claims, funding, or regulatory conversations\n- **Training & operations teams** testing whether learning transfers to real performance\n- **Labs & startups** building or validating VR/simulation-based research and assessment tools\n\nIf you’re unsure whether your project is “human factors” or “research,” that’s fine—many projects are both. We can frame the question in a way that produces actionable evidence.\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\nI use an **open, reproducible** model of consulting. You don’t just receive a report—you receive the assets that make the work durable: code, documentation, and (where relevant) prototypes and data dictionaries. The goal is to leave you with a capability, not a dependency.\n\n### 1. The Discovery Call (Free)\nWe schedule a **30-minute call** to understand your context, constraints, and what “success” looks like. I’ll tell you candidly whether I’m a good fit—and if not, what kind of specialist you likely need.\n\n*Outcome:* A clear go/no-go decision and a rough path to scope.\n\n### 2. First Deliverable: *The Blueprint*\nI deliver a blueprint that defines scope, measures, and deliverables.\n\n- For human factors projects: task model, evaluation plan, success criteria, and reporting format  \n- For VR projects: storyboard + “grey-box” prototype video  \n- For data work: mock-up of the final report/dashboard + analysis plan\n\n*Outcome:* You know exactly what you’re paying for, and what decisions the work will support.\n\n### 3. Second Deliverable: *Execution & Handoff*\nI build, evaluate, and deliver—then **train your team** to run and extend the system. You receive commented code and clear documentation (plus walkthrough videos when helpful).\n\n*Outcome:* A sustainable toolchain and evidence you can reuse.\n\n---\n\n## Ready to start?\n\n[Book a Free Discovery Call](contact.qmd){.btn .btn-primary .btn-lg role=\"button\"}\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI offer specialized **human factors consulting** for labs, startups, and technology teams building systems that people must use *reliably*—in the real world, under real constraints.\n\nI help you design and evaluate tools, interfaces, and workflows for **usability**, **safety**, and **human performance**.
